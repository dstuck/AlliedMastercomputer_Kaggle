giver_username_if_known: will be ignored for now since its post result data.
    also, it is in format N/A rather than None
    hahaha! the test data contains this info which should correlate 100% with recieving pizza

..._at_retrieval: data is also not relavent and will be pruned

requester_user_flair: data dropped since it contains answer
    just realized these arent in test anyways so dropping from train

post_was_edited: is dumb and not in test data anyway (you can see if they got pizza by whethe or not it is edited with no change to text)
    I'm making my own actually bool variable by comparing
